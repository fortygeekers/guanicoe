# guanicoe

Guanicoe is a set of Python scripts designed to interact with other programs to form an artificial intelligence-based chatbot system with artificial speech synthesis and automatic speech recognition capabilities. All this with the goal of having a system as much offline as possible.

It's mainly based on the following projects:

[LlaMa](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

[Vicuna-13B](https://huggingface.co/4bit/vicuna-13B-1.1-GPTQ-4bit-128g-GGML/resolve/main/vicuna-13B-1.1-GPTQ-4bit-128g.GGML.bin)

[OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

Nowadays, until I fond a better solution, the TTS can be done either:

pyttsx3: offline, poor voice quality.

festival tts: offline, acceptable voice quality, project seems that is not maintained.

gTTS: very good quality, but needs online conection to google translator services
